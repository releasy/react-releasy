# VCR

A class able to record and replay fetching results.

Usefull for testing purpouses, it will record all HTTP requests and replay on the later ones.

## Usage

```javascript
import { VCR } from 'react-releasy';

const link = new VCR({
  mode: VCR.MODE.AUTO,
  url: 'https://yourserveraddress.com/graphql',
});
```

## Why should I use VCR?

- Faster (no real HTTP requests are made anymore)
- Deterministic (the test will continue to pass, even if you are offline, or if the server goes down for maintenance)
- Accurate (the response will contain the same data you get from a real request)

## Modes

- **VCR.MODE.AUTO**: Record on first execution, replay the later ones.
- **VCR.MODE.RECORD**: Record all executions. (Overwrite data)
- **VCR.MODE.REPLAY**: Replay all executions.
